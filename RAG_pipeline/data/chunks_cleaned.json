Cezar Ashkar  June 30, 2025  Blog.\nTable of Contents Why Generative AI Fails to Deliver ROI — And How to Fix It Generative AI is everywhere, from customer support to code generation. But ask most companies what it’s doing for their bottom line, and the room gets quiet, fast. GenAI has taken the world by a storm, from writing code and marketing content to transforming customer support and knowledge management. Companies across various industries are racing to integrate GenAI in their workflows, since it seems everybody is doing it. But underneath the surface, a different reality is emerging. While adoption is widespread, measurable return on investment—aka ROI—is not. Companies are launching their own pilots, integrating tools, and building custom AI solutions. But many struggle to turn that into real business value. Everyone’s excited. Budget is enough. But the results? Disappointing. So why is GenAI failing to deliver on its promise for so many? In this blog, we explore the distance between implementation and impact, uncover the common traps organizations fall into, and outline a better path to unlocking the real value of Generative AI. The Hype vs. Reality Gap Enthusiasm alone doesn’t guarantee outcomes. In the rush to create, many leaders found themselves asking the question: where is the return? As many of them skipped foundational steps to ensure timely delivery and become “early adopters,” projects were launched without any clear objective, using useless data or lacking any actual alignment with their business priorities. As a result, many of them failed to scale. A recent McKinsey report found that while over 70% of businesses are experimenting with AI, only a fraction have achieved significant ROI. That gap between using GenAI and benefiting from it",

A recent McKinsey report found that while over 70% of businesses are experimenting with AI, only a fraction have achieved significant ROI. That gap between using GenAI and benefiting from it is growing wider—and more costly. Common Pitfalls in GenAI Adoption During the rush to deploy, most businesses struggle to convert their projects to measurable ROI. The reasons are often strategic and operational rather than technical. Below are the most common pitfalls that were observed. 1. No Clear Business Objective. Many adopted GenAI out of the feeling that they have to, but without any actual purpose like reducing cost, improving efficiency, or increasing revenue. When the “why” is unclear, so is the outcome. 2. No Measurable Success Metric. It is nearly impossible to improve what you don’t measure. Without any clear KPIs such as time saved, productivity gains, or impact on customer satisfaction, it is hard to track ROI or even prove its value to stakeholders. 3. Tech-First, People-Last. AI is a tool, not a standalone solution. It doesn’t create value on its own. It needs people to use it effectively. The problem is, many organizations rush to roll out GenAI tools but forget to bring their teams along for the ride. Without proper training, support, or a clear plan for how these tools fit into daily work, adoption stays low. Employees either don’t trust the tools, don’t see the value, or simply don’t know how to use them. The result? Great tech, sitting idle. 4. Poor Data Quality. Garbage data fed into an AI model results in sparkly but still garbage outcomes. GenAI is only as good as the data it has access to. What ROI in GenAI Should Look Like When done right, GenAI creates clear and measurable value. Here are a few signs that it’s delivering real ROI. 1. Efficiency Gains. Teams spend less time on manual tasks like summarizing text, drafting content, or searching for information. Example: A legal team cuts contract review time by 60%. 2. Better Customer Experience. AI responds faster and more accurately to customer needs. Example: A support team handles 30% more tickets with AI-generated responses. 3. Higher Productivity. Marketing, sales, and HR teams use AI to create campaigns, write emails, and prepare reports. Example: A marketing team generates copy in minutes instead of hours. 4. Revenue",

Example: A product team speeds up design iterations using AI-generated mockups. These results are possible when GenAI is aligned with clear goals and real business needs. A Simple Framework for Actually Getting ROI from GenAI If you want real value from GenAI, you need more than a shiny chatbot or a dozen pilots gathering dust. Here’s a simple framework to keep things grounded. V – Vision. Before you even assess or select a model, get clear on what you’re trying to achieve. Is your goal to reduce customer response times? Automate repetitive internal tasks? Improve content production? “Because it’s cool” is not a strategy. GenAI should support a real business objective, not just check an innovation box. Align it with your company’s goals so it’s solving problems that matter. Ask yourself: What business outcome are we targeting? How will success be defined? A – Assets. GenAI runs on more than just clever prompts—it needs the right foundation. If your data is scattered, outdated, or locked in siloed systems, your results will be just as disjointed. But data isn’t the only asset to consider. You also need the right infrastructure, tools, talent, and governance in place to support your AI goals. Make sure you have: 1. Clean, structured, and relevant data. 2. A scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. 3. Pre-trained models and toolkits. GenAI isn’t plug-and-play. These assets are what allow it to function, scale, and deliver value consistently—not just in a pilot. L – Levers. What’s the business lever GenAI can actually pull? Too many teams implement GenAI without knowing what needle they want to move. Focus on areas where impact is both meaningful and measurable. Think reduced time-to-resolution, increased conversion rates, or cost savings per task. Examples of value levers: 1. Productivity per employee. 2. Customer satisfaction scores. 3. Sales conversion or marketing output. 4. Hours saved on manual processes.",

Sales conversion or marketing output. 4. Hours saved on manual processes. No vague outcomes. No “let’s just see what happens.” Choose a lever and stick to it. U – User Enablement. The best AI tools in the world won’t matter if no one uses them. You need to actively onboard users, provide training, and build trust. People need to understand what the tool does, how to use it, and more importantly, how it helps them work better—not just harder. Watch for: 1. Lack of clarity: “What am I supposed to do with this?” 2. Shadow adoption: Employees secretly using third-party tools they’re more comfortable with. 3. Resistance: Skepticism that AI solutions might take over their jobs. Empower users early. Make it part of their workflow, not extra homework. E – Evaluation. If you’re not measuring, you’re guessing. Track performance from day one, run small experiments, collect feedback, and adjust. AI initiatives need a feedback loop—not just to show ROI, but to keep improving. What to measure: 1. Quantitative: usage data, efficiency gains, error rates, revenue impact. 2. Qualitative: user satisfaction, friction points, trust in the tool. 3. Time-bound checkpoints: Are we better off now than 30 days ago? Hope is not a plan. Evaluation turns intuition into insight. How We Help We’ve seen the excitement. We’ve also seen the reality check. At Digico Solutions, we help companies move past GenAI hype and focus on real outcomes. Whether you’re exploring your first use case or stuck in endless pilot mode, we work with your team to: 1.

Day three, a contractor queries confidential product roadmaps. Day four, you are in the CISO’s office explaining why your AI democratized information that was never meant to be democratic. Traditional AI assistants are like that friend who overshares at parties – they know everything and tell everyone. Amazon Q Business is more like a seasoned executive assistant who knows exactly who should know what, when, and why. What Makes Amazon Q Business Actually Different (Beyond the Marketing Speak) 1. It Speaks “Enterprise” Fluently While other AI tools require you to rebuild your entire data architecture, Amazon Q plugs into your existing setup like it was born there. SharePoint, Salesforce, Confluence, ServiceNow – it connects to over 40 enterprise systems without making you sweat. 2. Permission-Aware Intelligence This is not just about access control, it is about intelligent access control. Amazon Q does not just check if you can see something; it understands the context of why you should see something based on your role, team, and current project needs. 3. Actions, Not Just Answers Ask most AI assistants to create a Salesforce case for a customer issue and they will give you a helpful tutorial on how to do it yourself. Amazon Q actually does it. It is the difference between a reference librarian and a personal assistant. The Real-World Impact: Where Amazon Q Business Shines Scenario 1: Retail – Store Operations and SOP Access A store manager at a large retail chain is training new employees on return policies, POS issues, and how to handle gift card fraud, but the SOPs are buried in PDFs on SharePoint. Amazon Q Business in action: “ Q, what is our process if a customer wants to return a damaged appliance without a receipt?” Amazon Q Business: 1. Pulls the official policy from the internal SOP repo. 2. Checks if there are any recent updates to the return exception handling process. 3. Notes that gift card purchases without receipt are tagged for escalation. 4. Shows the manager a linked ServiceNow form for filing the exception report. Why it works: Store managers get precise, up-to-date procedures in plain English without calling HQ. Amazon Q reduces training overhead and enforces compliance quietly. Scenario 2: Energy – Field Engineer Troubleshooting A field technician at a utility company is diagnosing a transformer issue in a rural substation. Normally, they need to",

Scenario 2: Energy – Field Engineer Troubleshooting A field technician at a utility company is diagnosing a transformer issue in a rural substation. Normally, they need to dig through PDFs on a tablet or call dispatch. With Amazon Q Business: “Q, what’s the step-by-step for troubleshooting a 40kVA step-down transformer with inconsistent output voltage?” Amazon Q Business: 1. Pulls a verified internal procedure from an engineering SharePoint. 2. Cross-references with past incident tickets for this substation (via ServiceNow). 3. Flags a similar case last month that was solved by isolating a capacitor fault. 4. Outputs steps with part numbers and a request-to-replace form prefilled. Outcome: What used to be a 45-minute call to dispatch is now resolved on-site, with full traceability. When Amazon Q Business Makes Sense (And When It Doesn’t) Perfect Fit For: 1. Internal productivity use cases, where you need AI that understands your organizational structure. 2. English-language environments (other languages to be supported in the future). 3. Teams that want subscription-based pricing rather than usage-based billing. 4. Organizations with complex permission structures that need to be respected. Look Elsewhere If: 1. You are building customer-facing AI applications (try Amazon Bedrock instead). 2. You need multi-language support immediately. 3. You want to customize the underlying AI models extensively. 4. You are building the next ChatGPT competitor. The Bedrock vs. Q Business Decision Tree (Simplified) 1. Choose Amazon Bedrock if you are a developer building AI applications for others to use. 2. Choose Q Business if you are a business leader who wants your team to work smarter without becoming AI engineers. 3. Choose both if you realize different tools solve different problems.

Risks When Building and Training Generative AI Systems Privacy and Data Security Custom Generative AI models often require large datasets for training, which might include sensitive or personally identifiable information. Mishandling this data can result in breaches or outputs that infringe on privacy laws, necessitating secure data-handling practices. Lack of Transparency Generative AI models are complex and often operate as “black boxes”, making it difficult to understand how they generate outputs. This lack of transparency can hinder accountability, debugging, and the ability to explain decisions, especially in high-stakes applications. Cybersecurity Threats Custom AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to exploit weaknesses in the model. These attacks can compromise system integrity, requiring rigorous testing, robust security measures, and continuous monitoring during production deployment. Balancing Benefits and Risks of GenAI Generative AI has the potential to transform software development by automating routine tasks, enhancing productivity, and fostering creativity. However, its adoption comes with challenges such as privacy concerns, bias, and lack of transparency. These risks can be mitigated through careful planning, implementing ethical practices, and continuous monitoring. By addressing potential challenges proactively, teams can responsibly harness the transformative power of GenAI to drive innovation without compromising security, fairness, or reliability. The Future of Software Development Generative AI is more than just a tool, it is a transformative force in software development.

This exploration delves into the complexities, potentials, and the evolving future of this crucial intersection, highlighting both the hurdles that must be overcome and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead. Introduction To effectively train AI on Arabic, a thorough understanding of its unique linguistic features is paramount. The intricacies inherent in Arabic morphology, syntax, and its diverse dialectal variations pose significant hurdles for natural language processing (NLP) systems. Arabic possesses a remarkably rich morphological system, where words are constructed through the combination of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes, leading to a vast array of potential forms from a single root. For instance, the root “ع-ل-م”, meaning “knowledge” or “learning,” can produce words like “عِلْم” (knowledge), “عَالِم” (scientist or scholar), “تَعْلِيم” (education), and “مَعْلُومَة” (information). This characteristic presents a considerable challenge for NLP tasks. In Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the part-of-speech tag set encompasses over 300,000 tags, a stark contrast to the approximately 50 tags used for English. Furthermore, MSA words exhibit an average of 12 morphological analyses, compared to just 1.25 for English words. This quantitative difference underscores the sheer scale of morphological variations that AI models must learn to navigate when processing Arabic. Tasks such as morphological analysis, which involves determining all possible morphological analyses for a word, and morphological tagging, which identifies the correct analysis within a given context, become significantly more complex due to this richness. The non-concatenative nature of Arabic morphology, where vowels are interwoven among root consonants, further complicates the application of standard NLP techniques developed for languages with more straightforward word formation. The sheer volume of potential word forms necessitates specialized NLP tools and methodologies tailored specifically for Arabic, moving beyond those typically employed for morphologically simpler languages like English. Another significant hurdle arises from the common practice of omitting diacritics (short vowel markings) in standard Arabic writing. This absence of consistent diacritics introduces a substantial layer of ambiguity, as a single undotted word can represent multiple distinct words with different meanings and grammatical functions. For instance, the undotted word “كتب” can be interpreted in several ways",

      "original_text": " of consistent diacritics introduces a substantial layer of ambiguity, as a single undotted word can represent multiple distinct words with different meanings and grammatical functions. For instance, the undotted word “كتب” can be interpreted in several ways, such as “he wrote” (كَتَبَ), “it was written” (كُتِبَ), or “books” (كُتُب). This inherent ambiguity means that AI models must develop sophisticated contextual understanding capabilities to accurately disambiguate meaning, a challenge less pronounced in languages with more explicit orthographic conventions. Additionally, Arabic includes a significant number of irregular plural forms, often referred to as “broken plurals,” which do not adhere to predictable patterns. For example, the singular “قَلَم” (pen) becomes the plural “أَقْلَام” (pens), while “طِفْل” (child) becomes “أَطْفَال” (children). These irregularities further complicate morphological analysis and generation. Linguistic and Technical Barriers in Arabic NLP Beyond morphology, the syntax of the Arabic language also presents unique challenges for AI. Arabic allows for both nominal (subject-verb) and verbal (verb-subject) sentence structures, with a relatively flexible word order. While this flexibility contributes to the expressive power of the language, it poses a considerable hurdle for NLP applications that often rely on more rigid syntactic structures. Accurately parsing sentences and understanding the grammatical relationships between words becomes more complex when the word order is not fixed. This syntactic flexibility necessitates that NLP models developed for Arabic are more robust in handling variations in sentence structure compared to languages with stricter word order rules. Furthermore, Arabic is a heavily inflected language, meaning that the form of a word can change depending on its syntactic role within a sentence, adding another layer of complexity to syntactic analysis. The Spectrum of Dialects: A Major Hurdle and Opportunity One of the most significant linguistic challenges in processing Arabic for AI is the existence of numerous and diverse dialects. These dialects, spoken daily by Arabs, can differ substantially from MSA, sometimes to the extent that the differences are comparable to those between Romance languages and Latin. These variations affect all levels of linguistic analysis, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. Crucially, these dialects are primarily spoken, often lack standardized written forms, and have limited resources available for NLP research.",

Crucially, these dialects are primarily spoken, often lack standardized written forms, and have limited resources available for NLP research. Consequently, NLP tools and models trained predominantly on MSA data may not perform effectively when applied to dialectal Arabic without specific adaptation. However, addressing these dialectal variations also presents a significant opportunity to build AI applications that are more relevant, accessible, and culturally attuned to a wider segment of the Arabic-speaking population. The Arabic AI Data Ecosystem Compared to languages like English, there has historically been a relative scarcity of large, annotated Arabic language corpora and NLP tools. This lack of labeled datasets is particularly pronounced for less-resourced Arabic dialects and code-switching scenarios, where speakers frequently alternate between Arabic and other languages. However, efforts are underway to address this gap and create more comprehensive resources. For instance, the ArabicaQA dataset represents a significant step forward as the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for machine reading comprehension and open-domain question answering in Arabic. In specific NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, datasets such as the one available on Kaggle, containing 330,000 Arabic product reviews, and specialized datasets like ASAD and AraSenTi-Tweet indicate progress in building resources for particular applications. Furthermore, organizations like Shaip offer conversational and Text-to-Speech (TTS) datasets, including dialectal data from Gulf countries, catering to the growing need for speech-based AI applications. The University of Sharjah has also made strides by developing a deep learning system that utilizes a large, diverse, and bias-free dataset encompassing various Arabic dialects. While the situation is improving with the emergence of resources like ArabicaQA and dialect-specific datasets, there remains a need for more extensive, high-quality, and diverse datasets, particularly for under-represented dialects and a broader range of NLP tasks. The quality of Arabic language datasets is just as crucial as their availability for training effective and reliable AI models. Issues such as bias present in the data can lead to unintended consequences, including inconsistent content moderation and discriminatory decisions when AI is applied to Arabic content on social media platforms. The accuracy of annotations, which involves labeling data for specific NLP tasks, and the representativeness of the data in reflecting the diversity of the Arabic language are vital for ensuring robust model performance.

These models, based on the transformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating coherent Arabic text. Furthermore, multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R, while not exclusively trained on Arabic, have also shown strong performance on various Arabic NLP tasks. To address the challenges posed by dialectal variations, researchers have developed dialect-specific models like MADAR and multi-dialect BERT models, which are pre-trained on diverse Arabic dialects to improve performance on this complex aspect of the language. For specific NLP tasks, fine-tuned models like AraBERT-summarizer have emerged, demonstrating improved performance in areas like Arabic text summarization. Advancements in Arabic speech recognition have also been achieved through the use of end-to-end models based on the transformer architecture, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. The development of Arabic question answering datasets like Arabic-SQuAD and the creation of ArabicQA models are further indicators of the progress in enabling AI to understand and answer questions posed in Arabic. Additionally, the field of neural machine translation has seen substantial improvements in the quality of translations between Arabic and other languages through the application of transformer-based models. In the crucial area of information extraction, significant advancements have been made in Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) through the application of deep learning techniques, enabling more accurate identification and classification of entities within Arabic texts. Qatar’s groundbreaking Fanar project stands out as the first Arab AI model specifically designed to understand Arabic in all its diverse dialects, trained on an exceptionally large dataset of over 300 billion words. Moreover, MBZUAI has developed Jais, which is considered one of the most advanced Arabic large language models globally, showcasing the cutting-edge research being conducted in this field.

The development of dialect-specific models presents a unique opportunity to create AI applications that are specifically tailored to the linguistic nuances and cultural contexts of different Arabic-speaking regions, making these applications more relevant and user-friendly. Instead of solely viewing the characteristics of Arabic as obstacles, the focus is increasingly shifting towards understanding how these features can be strategically employed to develop more effective and innovative NLP solutions designed specifically for the language. Economic and Cultural Impact of Arabic AI The development and adoption of AI technologies for Arabic have substantial economic implications for the Arab world. Projections indicate that AI is poised to significantly boost GDP growth in countries like Saudi Arabia. For instance, generative AI alone is estimated to potentially contribute between SAR 60 billion to SAR 90 billion to Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product by 2030. AI has the potential to enhance productivity and efficiency across a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, education, and finance, leading to economic growth and the creation of new opportunities. Beyond the economic benefits, advancements in Arabic AI can play a vital role in addressing critical social needs and preserving the rich cultural heritage of the Arabic language. Ethical and Responsible Development As AI capabilities for Arabic continue to advance, it is essential to proactively address ethical considerations and the potential for biases in the underlying data and algorithms. Research has shown that AI models trained on biased data can lead to inconsistent and discriminatory content moderation for Arabic content on social media platforms, potentially resulting in the censorship of legitimate political discourse and the unintentional spread of harmful content. Recognizing this importance, countries like Saudi Arabia have already begun to develop ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to promote the responsible use of AI technologies. Conclusion: Embracing the Era of Arabic AI Training AI on the Arabic language presents a unique set of challenges, primarily stemming from the language’s rich morphology, syntactic flexibility, and the diversity of its dialects.

The truth is, a significant chunk of cloud spend is usually wasted or misallocated – money that companies could save with a bit of attention. In fact, industry surveys have found that roughly one-third of cloud budgets go to waste. The good news is that cloud cost optimization doesn’t require magic or heavy sacrifice – just some smart practices. In this post, we’ll highlight a few high-impact, yet approachable strategies (across all major cloud platforms) to trim your cloud costs without hurting performance. Cloud waste of high magnitude often happens not because cloud services are inherently expensive, but because users aren’t taking advantage of the many cost controls available. Common culprits include overprovisioning resources (allocating far more capacity than needed) and failing to scale down in time when demand drops. The silver lining is that issues like these are fixable. By being proactive and using the right features, you can ensure you’re only paying for what you actually need.

      "original_text": " down in time when demand drops. The silver lining is that issues like these are fixable. By being proactive and using the right features, you can ensure you’re only paying for what you actually need. Below, we’ll explore several key opportunities for cloud savings that are frequently overlooked. Right-Size Your Resources One of the simplest starting points is right-sizing your resources. This means adjusting the size and type of cloud instances, databases, or storage to match your actual workload requirements. Too often, companies deploy large servers for jobs that don’t really need that much capacity, or leave virtual machines running at very low utilization. Right-sizing is about matching capacity to need – no more, no less. The goal is to spend only what’s necessary while still meeting performance needs. Practically, this might involve downsizing an under-utilized VM, shifting to a more efficient instance family, or eliminating idle resources. All major cloud providers offer recommendations or tools to help with this (for example, AWS’s rightsizing recommendations or Azure Advisor’s suggestions). By periodically reviewing usage and implementing those suggestions, you can eliminate a lot of waste. Leverage Auto-Scaling Another powerful cost optimization strategy is to use auto-scaling wherever possible. Auto-scaling features (available in AWS Auto Scaling Groups, Azure Scale Sets, Google Cloud Instance Groups, etc.) automatically adjust the number of running instances or services based on demand. This means you can scale up to maintain performance during peak times, and just as importantly, scale down when load is low to avoid paying for idle servers. For example, you might configure a web app to add more instances when traffic spikes, then reduce capacity during quieter hours. By letting the cloud dynamically manage capacity, you ensure you’re only paying for the compute power actually needed at any given time. Auto-scaling not only saves costs during off-peak hours, but it also spares you from manual intervention – a win-win for efficiency and budget control. The key is to set sensible scaling rules so that your environment can adapt to your workload’s real requirements. Use Reserved Capacity and Savings Plans Cloud providers reward you for planning ahead. If you have workloads that run consistently, consider reserved instances, savings plans, or other committed use discounts. These options allow you to commit to a certain usage (often 1 or 3 years) in exchange for significantly lower pricing. The savings can be substantial – often ranging from 30% to 70% compared to pay-as-you-go rates. All major providers offer these models: AWS Reserved Instances and Savings Plans",

All major providers offer these models: AWS Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, Azure Reservations and Savings Plans, and GCP Committed Use Discounts. A good approach is to reserve the portion of your usage that is always running and predictable, while using on-demand or auto-scaling options for variable or peak usage. This combination gives you cost savings for steady workloads and flexibility for fluctuating demand. Monitor and Optimize Continuously You can’t optimize what you don’t observe. Setting up cost monitoring and alerts is essential to identify where your cloud budget is going and to catch inefficiencies. Cloud platforms provide native tools like AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management + Billing, and GCP’s Cost tools that help break down your spending by service and offer optimization recommendations. The key is to regularly review these reports where you might discover, for example, an unattached storage volume you’re unknowingly paying for, or an outdated workload that could be turned off. Many organizations struggle simply due to lack of visibility. Don’t let that be you. Make it a habit to check your cloud usage dashboards. Set up budget thresholds and alerts so that if spending for a service jumps unexpectedly, you’re notified early. By keeping an eye on costs, you’ll become aware of anomalies or drift in resource usage and can take action (such as rightsizing or shutting something down) before your cost is driven up. A culture of cost awareness, supported by the right tools, turns cloud optimization from a one-time project into an ongoing practice. Consider Serverless Architectures For certain applications, embracing serverless computing can lead to significant cost savings. Serverless services (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions) follow a pay-per-use model: you’re charged only when your code actually runs, rather than paying for an idle server that’s running all the time. This makes it very cost-efficient, especially for workloads that are intermittent or unpredictable. For example, a process that runs just a few times per day could end up costing much less under a serverless model than if it were running on a traditional server. Serverless platforms also automatically scale down to zero when not in use, so you aren’t billed for idle time. Even beyond functions, consider managed services that are “serverless” in the sense of scaling to zero – for instance, serverless databases or data warehouses",

Even beyond functions, consider managed services that are “serverless” in the sense of scaling to zero – for instance, serverless databases or data warehouses. By shifting appropriate parts of your architecture to serverless offerings, you can reduce costs and operational complexity at the same time. Final Thoughts Optimizing cloud costs doesn’t have to be complex. There are several practical strategies like right-sizing, using auto-scaling, planning reserved capacity, monitoring spend, and going serverless available on all major cloud platforms. And these don’t require deep architectural changes; just a proactive mindset and consistent review. It’s worth taking the time to review your cloud environment with cost in mind. Ask yourself: Are there resources running with low utilization? Services that should scale down when demand drops? Opportunities to use discounts you haven’t explored yet? Small changes can lead to meaningful savings. Cloud cost optimization is an ongoing process, but it’s one that pays off. Choose one area to focus on and start there, you’ll be surprised how quickly the benefits add up.

Nowadays, it is not coming for the future – it’s already embedded in today’s smartest businesses, and intertwining deep into their DNAs. From billion-dollar algorithms optimising every click and every recommendation, to behind the scenes AI innovations that are reshaping functions and transforming businesses inside out. Integrating AI into business operations has become a strategic imperative in 2025; companies leverage AI aiming to enhance efficiency, drive innovation, and maintain a competitive edge. Companies that are not aligning with today’s AI standards are considered outdated, and even losing their competitive edge; all companies, no matter the scale are being hit hard if they are not properly including AI in their ecosystems – a prime example is Apple where it has been heavily criticised and facing tremendous backlashes due to the quality of Apple Intelligence and Siri’s AI capabilities compared to other platforms including but not limited to Google Gemini. Wide Spread Adoption As we have covered, AI is taking businesses by storm – it was estimated that as of 2025, 78% of companies are reporting the use of AI in at least one business function, which is a 23% increase from 2023 alone. Not to mention that 71% of organizations have integrated generative AI tools into their operations which was increase from last year’s 65%. More and more investments and deals are being done by the day to increase the capabilities of AI – Global venture capital investment in AI startups alone exceeded 131.5 billion dollars in 2024 marking a 52% increase form 2023. Major companies themselves, are making a stand and investing absurd amounts in building AI infrastructures that accommodate the increase in demands. To highlight more on the infrastructure sides, Microsoft allegedly is committed with an 80 billion dollar to enhance AI infrastructure in fiscal 2025, and Meta platforms increased the expenditures to between 64 and 72 billion dollars to expand their AI capabilities. Innovations With all these investments, time, and labour, companies were able to develop innovative AI integration strategies to align with “Today’s AI Standards”.

The marketing and Advertising sectors are being engulfed with AI as well. Companies like Nike, BMW, Coca-cola, and many more are utilising AI to create personalised and creative marketing advertisements to fit their products and business needs. All of this while keeping in mind that myriad of AI tools are still in under development, yet still producing targeted and engaging marketing campaigns. Cost Reduction in financial operations is another factor for businesses deeply investing in AI. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund optimised their trading strategies aiming to save millions of dollars in transactions cost reduction through predictive analysis; financial cost reductions for businesses are happening in the cloud as well where cloud providers such as AWS are able to give predictive insights through services like AWS Trusted Advisor over the client’s infrastructure and provide AI recommendations to decrease them. Famous Integrations AI integrations are becoming countless by the day, hence it will be impossible to list all of them. But, some integrations are considered notable more than the others based on the amount of money invested, time, and effort. Meta platforms are on the top of list when it comes to AI efforts. They leveraged AI to improve ad targeting, resulting in an increased user engagement across all their platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Their CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving,” Microsoft is another company that leveraged AI into its Azure cloud services, where it was noted that the revenue growth in this segment in particular increased by 33%. Cognizant, is another company that jumped into the AI race, where it developed an AI agent using Vertex AI and Gemini aimed to assist legal teams in drafting contracts and assessing risks. Challenges in the Implementation Despite the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and the increase in artificial intelligence driven innovation and revenues, many companies are still struggling to realize meaningful returns on their investments, not to mention integrate these tools effectively into their operations. In fact, 74 percent of organizations report difficulty in scaling value from artificial intelligence initiatives. While it is tempting to attribute this to technical complexity, the root causes are often organizational: misaligned processes, lack of internal readiness, and resistance to change. Nevertheless, technical challenges do play a critical enabling role. Poor data quality, characterized by bias, inconsistency, or inaccuracy, undermines trust and results in flawed decisions.

Poor data quality, characterized by bias, inconsistency, or inaccuracy, undermines trust and results in flawed decisions. At the same time, a global shortage of artificial intelligence talent makes it more difficult to build and maintain effective solutions, especially in environments that lack internal expertise and structured support. More importantly, adopting artificial intelligence requires more than just technical adjustments; it requires a cultural transformation. Employee resistance, often driven by fears about job security or discomfort with new technologies, can stall even the most well-funded initiatives. Addressing this requires clear communication, focused training, and visible commitments to job evolution and upskilling. Wrapping up Today’s competitive edge is AI, as we stand in the cross roads between automation and augmentations, the businesses tend to thrive in AI will be those bold enough to innovate and wise enough to integrate AI fully and benefit from AI’s potentials and values. It is time for businesses to bridge the gaps of their businesses to leverage AI, weave AI into their operations fabric to unlock new efficiencies, insights, and innovations. Yet, this opportunity is turning into a responsibility, companies must navigate challenges in data quality, ethical dilemmas, talent shortages, and many more to fully unlock what AI promise us. As we move deeper into the AI-driven era, the question is no longer whether to adopt AI, but how boldly and how wisely you will use it to transform your future and turn your goals into a reality.

By combining Amazon Lex V2 with Amazon Bedrock, developers can create chatbots that not only understand user inputs but also provide personalized and contextually relevant responses. Practical Application: Now, without Further Ado, let’s delve into the steps we followed to build our demonstration chatbot for Digico Solutions, leveraging the power of Amazon Lex and Amazon Bedrock combined: Setting Up an S3 Bucket for Data Storage First, we established an S3 bucket to serve as our data repository. In this instance, we utilized it to store the web pages of our website, which will act as the primary data source for the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This repository functions as a reference for the Amazon Lex bot, facilitating its interactions. You can visualize this setup below. Lambda Function with S3 Access We then crafted a Lambda function to navigate through the web pages of our website and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket. To enable this process, we assigned an IAM role to the Lambda function, providing it with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and perform operations on it. Adding dependencies using Lambda Layers The code above requires packages like requests, boto3, and BeautifulSoup4, which aren’t automatically installed on Lambda. To resolve this, we turned to Lambda Layers. Launched a t2.micro EC2 instance running Ubuntu. Granted the EC2 instance permissions to write to our S3 bucket where custom layers are stored. Ran the following instructions to update the environment if needed and create the necessary dependency structure. 4. Installed all the packages we wanted for our layer on the EC2 instance. 5. Zipped the packages and uploaded them to S3. 6. As we uploaded our dependencies zipped on S3, we created a new lambda layer and uploaded the zipped file there. 7. Afterwards, we attached our new lambda layer to our lambda function. Following that, we aimed to automate the process of updating the data stored in the S3 bucket every six hours to ensure it remains current with any content updates made to the website. To achieve this, we utilized EventBridge scheduling, specifying the payload as our base URL and the bucket name. As demonstrated below: After completing this step, we verified the S3 bucket following the execution of the function triggered by the schedule to ensure",

As demonstrated below: After completing this step, we verified the S3 bucket following the execution of the function triggered by the schedule to ensure everything was functioning well. As depicted in the image below, all the web pages from our website are now successfully stored within the S3 bucket. Now, we can proceed to the next stage of creating the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. Establishing the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base We began by providing the necessary details for the knowledge base. 2. Next, we configured our data source, setting our previously created S3 bucket as illustrated below. 3. Lastly, we selected the appropriate embeddings model and configured the vector store to best suit our data. With everything set up and configured, we commenced the development of our Amazon Lex bot. Building the Amazon Lex Bot We started this step by choosing amazon lex bot’s creation method to be , which is a newly added feature to amazon lex that allow us to provide description in natural language to have lex generate a bot for us using large language models. Upon configuration completion, we were directed to a dashboard featuring a section labeled “intents.” An intent, as we learned, serves as a mechanism to execute actions in response to natural language user input. To harness the capabilities of GenAI with Lex effectively, we realized the importance of utilizing a bedrock-powered built-in intent. These intents leverage generative AI to fulfill FAQ requests by accessing authorized knowledge content. In the QnA Configuration section, we selected the knowledge base we had previously created. (You can locate the Knowledge Base ID in the Amazon Bedrock console) To advance with bot creation, we had to establish at least one custom intent. We opted for the to reply to greetings (feel free to add whatever you feel needed). To create your own intents, it’s essential to understand two key concepts: These define the types of data your bot expects to receive from the user. For example, a “Date” slot type would expect input like “today” or “next Monday.” These are examples of what users might say to trigger a specific intent. For the , utterances could include “hello,” “hi there,” or “good morning.” Thanks to Lex’s generative AI features powered by Amazon Bedrock, such as assisted slot resolution and sample utterance generation, we can easily add and configure slots and utterances for our intents.

      "original_text": " SageMaker. The result is infrastructure that can react and adapt in real-time. Unlike traditional automation pipelines, which follow predefined if-this-then-that logic, AI agents evaluate context. A failed ECS deployment, for example, might trigger an EventBridge rule, invoking a Lambda function that submits recent logs to an LLM for analysis. The model evaluates common failure patterns — misconfigured ports, container crash loops, resource limits — and responds accordingly. Depending on confidence thresholds, the agent can either revert the deployment, open a detailed GitHub issue, or notify an engineer with suggested remediations. This isn’t just about speed. AI agents help reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), detect anomalies before they escalate, and offload repetitive tasks from engineers. For fast-moving teams, especially in production environments, this improves stability and accelerates delivery cycles. Cost savings also emerge when agents can detect waste — such as underutilized EC2 instances or misconfigured autoscaling — and act to shut them down or optimize provisioning in real-time. Designing these agents requires clear guardrails. You don’t want a model rewriting task definitions or provisioning new infrastructure without validation steps. Every action taken by the agent must be logged, explainable, and reversible. Explainability becomes critical when AI decisions directly impact uptime or cost. Teams should also consider using fine-tuned models for log parsing and action selection, particularly for sensitive environments. What’s changing now is the maturity of the ecosystem. Serverless infrastructure removes operational overhead. Foundation models bring reasoning. Event-driven patterns connect everything with minimal latency. The convergence of these technologies makes AI-powered, cloud-native operations not only viable but production-ready. In the coming months, we’ll see tighter integrations between AI agents and MLOps pipelines, AIOps dashboards, and security operations tooling. This isn’t replacing DevOps — it’s augmenting it. Engineers who understand how to build, supervise, and evolve these agents will be leading the next phase of cloud-native operations.

However, if not properly managed, it can lead to performance issues, unnecessary costs, and security vulnerabilities. This guide highlights key pitfalls and best practices to help optimize your DynamoDB implementation. Designing Inefficient Partition Keys DynamoDB partitions data across multiple storage nodes based on the partition key. A poorly chosen key can lead to uneven data distribution and performance bottlenecks. Common mistakes include using sequential values (timestamps, auto-incremented IDs) that overload a single partition and selecting a low-cardinality key with few unique values. To optimize: – Choose a high-cardinality partition key to evenly distribute data. – Use composite keys (partition key + sort key) for efficient data retrieval. – Implement write sharding by adding a random suffix to partition keys. Overusing Scans Instead of Queries DynamoDB queries are optimized for retrieving data using indexed attributes, while Scan operations read the entire table, making them inefficient and costly. Common mistakes include using Scan instead of Query and failing to design a schema that supports efficient queries. To optimize: – Always use Query over Scan when possible. – Design tables with Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) to support multiple query patterns. – If scans are necessary, apply filters to minimize data retrieval. Mismanaging Read and Write Capacity DynamoDB offers Provisioned and On-Demand capacity modes. Misconfiguring them can lead to throttling or unnecessary costs. Common mistakes include overprovisioning capacity, underprovisioning leading to degraded performance, and choosing the wrong capacity mode for the workload. To optimize: – Use On-Demand mode for unpredictable workloads. – Use Provisioned mode with auto-scaling for steady traffic. – Enable DynamoDB adaptive capacity to handle traffic spikes automatically.

      "original_text": ": – Use On-Demand mode for unpredictable workloads. – Use Provisioned mode with auto-scaling for steady traffic. – Enable DynamoDB adaptive capacity to handle traffic spikes automatically. Treating DynamoDB Like a SQL Database Applying SQL-style normalization to DynamoDB can create inefficiencies, requiring multiple lookups instead of optimized single-table queries. Common mistakes include normalizing data excessively and expecting to perform complex joins and aggregations like in SQL databases. To optimize: – Denormalize data when needed to reduce query overhead. – Use a single-table design with well-planned keys. – Structure data based on access patterns rather than SQL-style relationships. Overlooking Security Best Practices Security misconfigurations can expose sensitive data and create vulnerabilities. Common mistakes include granting excessive IAM permissions, leaving DynamoDB tables publicly accessible, and not enabling encryption. To optimize: – Follow the principle of least privilege when setting IAM roles. – Use AWS KMS encryption for secure data storage. – Restrict access using VPC endpoints when necessary. Ignoring Indexes and Alternative Query Paths DynamoDB supports Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSI) to enable efficient queries. Not using them can lead to slow and costly operations. Common mistakes include storing data without indexes and using multiple tables instead of leveraging GSIs. To optimize: – Use GSIs to create additional query paths. – Use LSIs when sorting data within a partition is required. – Regularly monitor index usage to optimize costs. Failing to Monitor and Optimize DynamoDB provides monitoring tools to track performance, security, and costs. Ignoring these can lead to hidden inefficiencies. Common mistakes include not tracking CloudWatch metrics, failing to analyze DynamoDB Streams, and ignoring AWS Trusted Advisor recommendations. To optimize: – Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual read/write patterns. – Use AWS Config rules to detect security misconfigurations. – Regularly review index usage and capacity settings. Conclusion: Maximizing DynamoDB Performance and Efficiency Using DynamoDB effectively is like running a well-organized restaurant. If the kitchen is set up correctly, orders are processed efficiently, ingredients are readily available, and customers get their meals without delays. However, a poorly managed kitchen, where orders pile up, ingredients are scattered, and staff are overloaded, leads to slow service and wasted resources. Similarly, improper DynamoDB design can result in higher costs, performance issues, and operational inefficiencies.

A mathematician and the daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace saw something in Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine that no one else could: its potential to be more than just a calculating machine. In 1843, she published notes that included what is considered the first computer algorithm – an extraordinary feat in an era when women were largely excluded from scientific circles. She envisioned machines that could create music, generate graphics, and go beyond mere number-crunching. Her insights were so profound that they weren’t fully appreciated until nearly a century later when modern computers began to realize her prophetic vision. The Code Breakers of World War II: Women Behind the Machines During World War II, while history books often highlight military strategists, a group of extraordinary women were solving complex mathematical problems that would change warfare and",

      "original_text": " began to realize her prophetic vision. The Code Breakers of World War II: Women Behind the Machines During World War II, while history books often highlight military strategists, a group of extraordinary women were solving complex mathematical problems that would change warfare and computing forever. The ENIAC programmers – Jean Jennings Bartik, Kay McNulty, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas, and Ruth Lichterman – were the first to program the world’s first general-purpose electronic computer. Working with the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), these women didn’t just operate a machine; they fundamentally understood and programmed it at a time when computer programming didn’t even exist as a defined profession. They wrote complex ballistics trajectory programs, debugging the machine with nothing more than logical thinking and extraordinary mathematical skills. Grace Hopper: The Admiral Who Spoke the Language of Computers If computing had a rebel, it would be Grace Hopper. A rear admiral in the U.S. Navy and a pioneering computer scientist, Hopper developed the first compiler – a revolutionary tool that translated human-readable code into machine language. Her work laid the groundwork for COBOL, a programming language that became the backbone of business computing for decades. Hopper was famous for her unconventional approach and memorable quote: “It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.” She quite literally invented the concept of machine-independent programming languages, making computing accessible to people beyond mathematical elites. Bridging the Past and Present: Women in Tech Today These women didn’t just work in technology – they transformed it. They overcame significant societal barriers, working in fields where women were rarely welcomed, let alone celebrated. Their contributions extend far beyond technical achievements; they challenged fundamental assumptions about women’s capabilities in science and engineering. As we celebrate technological innovation today, we stand on the shoulders of these giants. They didn’t just write code or design machines – they imagined entire worlds of possibility that we now take for granted. Women’s Role in Modern-Day Technology Women continue to make remarkable strides in technology, leading groundbreaking research and championing diversity in tech startups. Leaders like Fei-Fei Li, who has been pivotal in advancing AI research, Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM, who revolutionized the cloud and AI space, and Radia Perlman, a pioneering network engineer, are empowering the next generation of technologists.

      "original_text": " Computing in the GCC: A Roadmap to Digital Transformation Anas Al-Baqeri  December 10, 2024  Blog.\nTable of Contents The GCC’s digital landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation. Driven by ambitious national initiatives like Saudi Vision 2030 and the UAE’s Digital Economy Strategy, organizations across the region are rethinking their technological foundations. This shift is not merely about adopting new tools, but about positioning the Gulf states at the forefront of global digital innovation. Understanding the Economics of Cloud in the GCC When it comes to cloud computing, the numbers speak for themselves. GCC-based organizations can achieve significant cost optimizations by migrating to the cloud. Recent studies indicate potential reductions of 30-40% in overall IT spending over three years, 45% decreases in infrastructure maintenance costs, and 60% improvements in resource utilization. However, as Gartner analysts have noted, regional factors like data residency requirements and unique local pricing models demand a thorough Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis. Upfront planning is crucial to unlocking the true cost savings of cloud. Manage or Grow, The Choice is Yours GCC companies often face challenges in managing cloud infrastructure in-house. IDC research reveals that 45% struggle to find and retain qualified cloud engineers, while 62% experience higher costs than initially projected. Moreover, 38% encounter unexpected compliance hurdles, and 55% grapple with providing 24/7 monitoring and maintenance. A prime example is Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company. By leveraging cloud technologies and partnering with managed service providers, Aramco has achieved significant cost savings, improved operational efficiency, and accelerated innovation. The data points to a clear strategic advantage for leveraging managed cloud services. Analysis shows that GCC organizations using third-party providers save an average of 25-35% compared to self-management, while also benefiting from 40% faster delivery of new features and 65% improved security incident response times. A prominent GCC e-commerce platform exemplifies these benefits: “We used to have 8 engineers managing our infrastructure. After moving to managed services, those same engineers now focus on customer experience and business innovation. Our deployment frequency has doubled, and our operational costs have decreased by 30%.” Beyond financial savings, managed cloud services offer GCC businesses access to 24/7 expert support, automatic compliance with regional regulations, continuous security updates, and the specialized expertise required to navigate the complexities of multi-cloud environments. When evaluating partners, organizations should prioritize providers with a strong local presence and deep understanding of the regional",

In other words, the Migration Assessment tool helps your company migrate to the cloud smartly and with the least costs! Strategy is a key! AWS provides powerful tools that are fundamentally capable of providing companies with all needed functionalities to ensure successful migration to the cloud. However, having powerful means needs careful planning as well. AWS offers a comprehensive set of migration strategies to help customers move their applications and data to the cloud. These strategies, known as the “6 Rs”, provide a structured approach to assess, plan, and execute cloud migrations. The rehost or “lift-and-shift” strategy involves migrating applications to the cloud without making any changes to the underlying architecture. This is a popular approach for enterprises looking to quickly move a large number of servers from on-premises to the cloud. For example, Expedia Group used the rehost strategy to migrate over 80% of its infrastructure to AWS, reducing its data center footprint by 85%. The replatform or “lift, tinker, and shift” strategy involves making some optimizations to the application during migration, such as leveraging managed database services like Amazon RDS. This approach allows organizations to take advantage of cloud-native capabilities without a complete application redesign. Intuit, the financial software company, used replatforming to migrate its TurboTax application to AWS, improving scalability and reducing infrastructure management overhead. In the repurchase or “drop and shop” strategy, companies move from on-premises software to a SaaS model. This allows them to take advantage of the latest features and managed services without the burden of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Pearson, the education technology company, repurchased its HR and finance applications, moving to AWS-hosted SaaS solutions. For applications that require more significant changes, the refactor or “re-architect” strategy involves redesigning the application to be cloud-native, leveraging services like AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS, and Amazon DynamoDB. While more complex, this approach can unlock greater performance, scalability, and cost optimization. Expedia Group also used refactoring to modernize its core hotel search application, improving response times by 40%. Challenges and Best Practices Migrating to the cloud can present a",

Expedia Group also used refactoring to modernize its core hotel search application, improving response times by 40%. Challenges and Best Practices Migrating to the cloud can present a range of challenges that organizations must address to ensure a successful transition. One of the main concerns is data security and compliance. Enterprises must ensure the protection of sensitive data during the migration process and maintain compliance with industry regulations like HIPAA and PCI-DSS. Pearson, the education technology company, addressed this by implementing strong encryption and access controls when migrating its HR and finance applications to AWS-hosted SaaS solutions. Another common challenge is cost management. The pay-as-you-go nature of cloud services can lead to unexpected expenses if not properly monitored and optimized. Intuit, the financial software company, overcame this by carefully planning its migration to AWS, leveraging the AWS Pricing Calculator to model costs and right-size its infrastructure. This allowed Intuit to reduce costs by 25% after migrating its TurboTax application. Skill gaps among IT staff can also hinder a smooth migration. To address this, organizations should provide comprehensive training and support to upskill their teams. Expedia Group, for example, utilized AWS training resources and worked closely with AWS experts to ensure its staff had the necessary skills to manage its migrated applications on AWS. To ensure a successful migration, organizations should follow best practices like conducting pre-migration testing, implementing robust security measures, and continuously monitoring and optimizing their cloud environment. Pearson, for instance, thoroughly tested its applications before migrating to AWS-hosted SaaS solutions to ensure successful transition. Expedia Group also maintained a strong focus on security, leveraging AWS security services to protect its migrated applications.

But here’s a question for you: Have you heard about the Heartbleed vulnerability breach in 2014? Or did you know that 700 million malware attempts were recorded in 2021 alone? Or even that according to Cybersecurity ventures, cyberattacks are deemed to cost companies a north of $10 trillion dollars by 2025, which was an increase from the $3 trillion in 2015. These are not trends or events – this is a genuine crisis. Let me hit you all with a sobering reality – you might think major corporations are too fortified or immune to fall into the trap of cyber breaches, but the history tells a different story; in 2014, Heartbleed exposed a vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library which lead to massive leaks of personal information, and in 2017 WannaCry ransomware caused over $4 billion in damages affecting hospitals, businesses, and governments worldwide. All of these are just the tip of the iceberg, these are not isolated incidents – these are wake-up calls to all the companies present now and in the future. As the digital landscape evolves, so do the risks. Innovations in AI, IoT, and cloud computing bring endless possibilities- but they also expand the surface of attack. Cybersecurity aids in the continuation of our day-to-day financial transactions, securing personal information, progression of businesses, safeguarding national security, and much more. Despite its importance, and the growth of threats, many organizations and businesses still see cybersecurity as a liability and even in some cases overthought and left till the end of the development phases prioritizing customer experience and speed over security leading to reactive strategies instead of proactive defense mechanisms. The paradox of cybersecurity lies in its invisibility, when it works, no one bats an eye, when it fails, the consequences are devasting. As Kevin Mitnick – a former hacker and cybersecurity consultant once put it, “The question is not if you will be hacked, but when”. In the light of this, let’s explore practical and critical steps that aids in securing your infrastructures and businesses, whether on-premises or in the cloud and minimize the risks of a breach.

      "original_text": " be hacked, but when”. In the light of this, let’s explore practical and critical steps that aids in securing your infrastructures and businesses, whether on-premises or in the cloud and minimize the risks of a breach. Strengthening Cybersecurity Frameworks with Multi-Factor Authentication and Encryption Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – MFA is a simple yet affective security mechanism; implementing MFA into your infrastructures adds an extra level of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verifications before accessing your systems decreasing unauthorized access. Forms like – OTPs (One Time Passwords), Email and authentication applications or devices codes, knowledge-based MFAs by providing information only the users know about, biometric authentication, and more made MFA more accessible than ever. Cloud providers such as AWS and Azure, made the implementation of MFA even more straightforward. For example, Azure Active Directory support conditional policies depending on the user location, device, and network, and AWS offers MFA with virtual authenticator apps or physical devices. Encryption – encrypting data ensures that it will remain secure, transforming them to unreadable formats which only authorized parties are able to decrypt. Encryption in-transit ensures that even if the connection is intercepted by a “man in the attack”, your data remains unharmed. Cloud service providers often offer built-in encryption tools to help you secure your data; both AWS and Azure, support different built-in services to help manage the encryption of your data, such as AWS Key Management Service and Azure Key Vault. Azure, for instance, support both RSA 2048, RSA 3072, and other forms of transparent encryption for data at rest in their databases and supports customer managed encryption where you can manage the encryption of your data using your own encryption keys for maximum controls. Invest in Threat Intelligence Tools and Regular Security Audits Threat Intelligence tools – these are tools that aim to provide real-time insights into potential threats and possible areas of breaches, which enables organizations to proactively defend against cyberattacks and breaches. In cloud environments, threat intelligence can help identify and mitigate risks associated with shared resources and hybrid resources. In addition, cloud services provide several different services that aim to analyze your infrastructures against best practices and tests which highlight the parts that needs to be reinforced – such services include AWS GuardDuty, Micrsoft Defender Threat Intelligence for the cloud, and Google Chronicles.

Regular Security Audits – conducting comprehensive evaluations of your infrastructures aid in unveiling some hidden vulnerabilities and ensure that the resources and actions being done align with the compliances. Also, audits provide a room for recommendations to remediate and improve the environment to further secure it. AWS Trusted Advisor is built-in service from AWS that provides recommendations to optimize the performance and cost, Azure Advisor is another service that analyzes and provides recommendations to make your infrastructure more cost optimized and increase its performance, and Google Cloud Security Command Center that give comprehensive security and risk management platform for monitoring Google Cloud resources. Prepare for Potential Regulatory Changes, Including Data Protection Laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) Understanding Regulations – compliances and laws like the General Data Protection Regulations and the California Privacy Act are found to set strict standards for data privacy and security; these data protection laws protect the rights and the safety of the users against data breaches and leaks of their personal information. Non-compliant businesses to these laws, depending on the region you are present in, can result in hefty fines that can range from thousands to millions of dollars, reputational damages to the business, and even subject your business to penalties. It is essential to understand how these regulations apply to your cloud services and ensure that your data handling practices ratify the required standards. Cloud Providers follow several different Data Protection Laws and offer compliance programs such as AWS Compliance Program, Azure’s Trust Center, and Google Cloud’s compliance framework; some of the laws that Cloud Providers follow are GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI DSS for financial transactions. Implement a Robust Disaster Recovery Plan and Conduct Regular Mock Drills Disaster Recovery Plan – developing a disaster recovery plan is an essential step while designing your infrastructure. Some on-prem corporations tend to delay or ignore having a disaster recovery plans as it is expensive to replicate and maintain another on-prem environment in case of a failure. However, cloud providers support Disaster Recovery Plans from on-prem to the cloud and to their cloud environment from one region to another. Some of the disaster recovery services include Azure Site Recovery which aids in failing over from one region to another, and AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery which aims to minimize downtime and data loss of on-prem and cloud-based applications.

Conducting Regular Mock Drills – simulating cyberattack scenarios helps to prepare the team and the environment to handle and respond cyberattacks during actual cyber breaches. These drills can identify the key weaknesses of your infrastructure and improve the coordination between team members. Not to mention that, testing failovers from one region to another or from the on-prem to the cloud failover is essential to make sure that the failover plan is feasible and able to accommodate actual server downs. Azure Site Recovery support a failover test where it performs the failover to the secondary region without affecting the main region, and AWS supports penetration testing, of course within guidelines, to test the infrastructure’s resiliency and availability against cyber-attacks and region outages. Stay Updated with Security Patches Systems and servers are becoming increasingly complicated due to various connections, intricate links, and complex communications between different environments. Not including the fact that virtually, there isn’t a flawless system; hence, regularly checking and updating your systems to patch vulnerabilities is crucial in preventing exploits, this includes applying patches to the Operating Systems, applications, virtual machines, and all your resources. The history proved that such incidents happened, this includes the previously mentioned Heartbleed security exploit and the shellshock incident exploiting a bug in the bash command -line. With the cloud in sight, all these security patches can be taken care of by using managed services provided by multiple cloud venders, including AWS, Azure, and GCP. These venders are responsible for scaling, securing, and updating your resources while you focus your time and effort on developing your applications – using managed services can be more expensive than unmanaged resources, but it is a price worth to pay to protect yourself and your users from unintentional bugs due outdated patches leading to an exploit. This checklist alone does not take into account all the measures and points needed to secure your infrastructure; beyond MFA, encryptions, and disaster recovery plans, there are additional steps that lie onto you and the users – raising awareness against malwares and phishing attacks, implementing high availability against DDoS threats, strengthening endpoint protections, and the list goes on. Securing your systems is an ongoing process that requires continuous vigilance and proactive strategies – this is not discouraging, it’s quite the opposite, delving into this world and knowing you are following all the necessary procedure to secure yourself and your environment brings some peace within.

They are part of our reality. Who would have thought our lives would be so dependent and intertwined with AI to the point that not a day goes by without any of us merely utilizing one or two of those tools? In 2024, AI tools are heavily integrated in our workspaces and projects, enhancing productivity by generating stunning visuals on-demand, and condensing complex information making us achieve more than ever before. This all sounds so surreal, right? Speaking loudly about such innovations make AI sound – flawless, almost too good to be true. Yet, as is often the case, hidden things lie in the fine print. AI is not without flaws. Like everything created by us, AI bound to be constrained to our ingenuity, intelligence, and most importantly our values and morals. These systems are trained to act like us, talk like us, think like us, and even take decisions to solve problems like us. But what happens when biases, oversights, or ethical lapses creep into their design? As Kate Crawford wisely put it: “Like all technologies before it, artificial intelligence will reflect the values of its creators. So, inclusivity matters – from who designs it to who sits on the company boards and which ethical perspectives are includes.” Risk of Unethical AI Recent discussions around AI often emphasize on its benefits – enhanced productivity, efficiency, and innovation across myriad sectors. While these advancements are transformative and even revolutionary in some cases, it is equally important to break the cycle and expose the darker side of things – the ethical risks of AI’s misuse, biased training, and unintended consequences due to personal gains. Below, we will be exploring some of those unethical practices. Bias and Discrimination: AI models have been increasingly used in the in the workplace – facial recognition security mechanisms, resume checkers for HR filtering and recruitments, smart assistants, performance analysis practices, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, unchecked biases in datasets used to train the AI models can lead to discriminatory outcomes, causing societal inequalities and racial consequences. A case of unethical training of AI models involves the facial recognition technologies. A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technolgy revealed many systems misidentifies people of color at significantly larger rates compared with people with white skin colors- leading to false arrests, privacy violations, and faulty claims. According to American Civil Liberties Union",

According to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the criminal justice system portrays some racial biases – quoting: “… because of racial biases in the criminal justice system”. Amazon’s Rekognition tool that was trained on mugshot dataset, incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress to mugshot images disproportionately affecting people of color. Privacy Invasion: Imagine a multi-million-dollar company using your photos to train a facial recognition AI algorithm without your consent; AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, raising significant concerns about consent and privacy. Misuse of this data can lead to ethical breaches and violations of trust. For instance, Clearview AI faced global criticism for scraping billions of photos from social media platforms without user consent; the company built a dataset for a facial recognition algorithm based on those photos and sold the trained AI models to law enforcement agencies worldwide, raising alarms about surveillance and misuse. They were later fined with 30$ million in Europe for violating people’s privacy. Misuse of AI: We got across several cases on the unethical training of AI models, but how about the unethical use of AI models for “our personal gains”? We always go back to the remarkable benefits of AI in our lives; but these same systems are so powerful that are capable to be used for malicious purposes. We’ve all read about the misuse of AI systems with voice alterations, deep fake videos, and even prompting AI to do our work/personal studies for you. Deepfake videos, in particular, has been misused the most for fraud and misinformation manipulation. A notable example is the March 2019 UK scam where scammers defrauded a UK-based energy company. The scammers used deepfake audio that convincingly imitated the CEO’s voice defrauding them with a whopping 243000$. This incident demonstrated how convincing AI-generated media could be used for identity imitation and how it can be exploited for financial and reputation harm. Autonomy Risk: Autonomous activities have been circulating our workspaces for years now; CI/CD practices, autonomous driving vehicles, automation in Manfacturing, and many other cases. These resulted in myriads of advancements and improvements and in efficiency.

On the other hand, such technologies introduced new safety and ethical challenges; unintended deployments of code versions, safety hazards on civilians, and even a huge curve in the unemployment and laying off rates. One example of such hazards would be in 2018, an Uber autonomous vehicle tragically struck and took the life of a pedestrian in Arizona due to a failure in object recognitions. Investigators revealed that software limitations and the delay in braking configurations were key contributors in the incident as Uber prioritized “smooth driving” over pedestrian’s safety. Data Misuse: Data breaches and unconsented use of personal information are recurring events in the unethical world of AI. These breaches are used to exploit personal information to scam people, spread false information, and the list goes on and on. Scandals of such sorts happened in numerous of occasions and events, including the U.S. elections with the Cambridge Analytica Scandal. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica was involved in exploiting personal information from the social media platform Facebook, taking advantage of its, at the time, weak data privacy policies to target U.S. voters. During the 2016 presidential elections, about 87 million Facebook profiles were improperly accessed through an app created by the GSR (Global Science Research). The data was used to create psychographic profiles, deliver highly targeted advertisements, and promote voting campaigns. This breach of trust raised serious concerns about consent and the ethical use of AI in influencing public opinion. Proposed Solutions Addressing the ethical dilemmas stemming for unethical uses of AI requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving developers, companies, governments, and the society as a whole. Here are some practical solutions to tackle some of the key issues: Diversifying Training Data – ensuring datasets are representative of diverse populations is a must to minimize bias. This includes systematic checks and audits, review practices and development strategies, and utilizing tools like IBM’s AI Fairness 360 toolkit which detect and mitigates bias in machine learning models or Amazon’s SageMaker Clarify to detect, provide explanation during data processing, and supply with predications against biases in datasets. Safeguarding Privacy – this might sound abstract, yet we will try to dig deeper into it. One way to ensure privacy in AI is incorporating privacy-preserving measures such as differential privacy to ensure data cannot be traced or linked to people within large dataset or using AWS’ Macie to filter out personal information automatically in S3 Buckets. Another way would be promoting transparency – companies",

      "original_text": " AI is incorporating privacy-preserving measures such as differential privacy to ensure data cannot be traced or linked to people within large dataset or using AWS’ Macie to filter out personal information automatically in S3 Buckets. Another way would be promoting transparency – companies must clearly communicate to how personal data is used in their AI systems, provide user-friendly processes with comprehensive consent mechanisms to give the users a choice to share their data or not. An example would be with Apple’s privacy labels on apps to allow users to see how their personal data is collected and used. Preventing Misuse – this can be done by creating ethical policies, governments and organizations must define clear guidelines about what constitutes acceptable AI usage and setting fines against any breaches. Educating the public and raising awareness about AI related fraudulent activities such as deepfake videos is important to increase the chances of identifying scams and not get defrauded – MIT have created online courses for detecting deepfake videos that can be accessed by the public. Managing Autonomy Risks – Developing a comprehensive testing protocols are a must in order to avoid any unintentional AI acts. Simulating environments and undergoing extensive real-world testing to identify edge cases and ensuring safety are one way to manage autonomy. Requiring real-time monitoring of autonomous systems need to be implemented to adhere to safety standards and avoid any tragic incidents. Tesla and Waymo strengthened their testing protocols and introduced a more robust detection system to their vehicles.

According to Forbes Advisor, “2023 saw a 72% increase in data breaches since 2021, which led the previous all-time record.” As businesses continue to migrate to the cloud, securing infrastructure becomes a critical concern. Built for scalability, reliability, and sustainability, AWS offers numerous multi-layered security tools that proactively defend cloud environments. Through constant monitoring and advanced automation, AWS enables organizations to mitigate security risks while maintaining operational efficiency. Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model Cloud security isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach—it requires clear boundaries between what AWS secures and what your organization is responsible for. AWS fortifies the physical infrastructure, ensuring the safety of its global data centers and the underlying network. On the other side, you hold the reins when it comes to safeguarding your data, applications, and workloads.

      "original_text": " security controls that align with their specific needs, without compromising the strength of the underlying infrastructure. The Blueprint for Cloud Security: Best Practices for a Resilient Infrastructure Elevating Security with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) In an era where data breaches can have devastating consequences, managing who has access to your cloud resources is paramount. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) empowers organizations to define and control individual user permissions, ensuring that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right time. One of the standout features of IAM is its integration with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security for privileged accounts. Whether you choose software-based solutions like mobile authenticator apps or hardware tokens, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, making your cloud environment that much more secure. IAM isn’t just about restricting access; it also simplifies user management through federated access. With IAM, your employees and applications can authenticate to the AWS Management Console and service APIs using existing identity systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory. This integration minimizes administrative burdens and streamlines the user experience, allowing your team to focus on what truly matters—driving innovation and growth. Additionally, AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On) revolutionizes how organizations manage access across multiple AWS accounts and applications. With centralized control, businesses can easily provision and deprovision access based on changing roles, ensuring that employees have the necessary access to do their jobs while maintaining tight security controls. Navigating the Terrain of Network Security Network security is not merely an option; it’s a fundamental necessity. AWS empowers organizations to build resilient networks that serve as formidable barriers against cyber threats. Central to this defense is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing you to carve out a secure space in the cloud, ensuring that resources are accessible only to those who need them. With VPC, you can design your network architecture, incorporating features like Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs). Security Groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to instances, while NACLs provide additional defense by regulating traffic at the subnet level. For organizations seeking to streamline connectivity across multiple environments, AWS Transit Gateway facilitates efficient communication between VPCs and on-premises networks while maintaining strict security controls. This allows your data to flow securely and seamlessly, regardless of its origin or destination. Moreover, AWS Firewall Manager offers centralized oversight, enabling the implementation and management of firewall rules across your entire AWS organization. This consistency in policy",

The first way, via the console, is the easiest yet the most time-consuming. The second way, which is through the CLI, has more granular control and can be very challenging. Last but not least, deploying using code is every developers dream. What is IaC? Infrastructure as code is your ticket to impressing your manager, your tech-y crush, or your colleagues. Instead of taking note of everything you’re deploying, keeping track of your service permissions, navigating through 30 maybe 40 tabs on your browser/console to make sure you have done everything right (based on a true story), you can rest easy with your IaC. Services: If you have never heard of IaC before, you might be wondering what services are commonly used to deploy your infrastructure. On AWS, the main IaC service is CloudFormation (CF), where templates are written in either JSON or YAML, then deployed through the console or CLI. CloudFormation has some cool features like: Stack Sets: which is a feature that allows you to create, update, and delete AWS CloudFormation stacks in multiple AWS accounts and multiple AWS regions within each AWS account, to change sets, which are generated by CloudFormation by comparing your stack with the changes you submitted. CloudFormation Drift (my favorite feature): Discover what service had a configuration change after deploying your infrastructure, this would help you make sure your template is still within the rails, and would protect you from some of the “i wanted to know what this does” interns. Terraform is as a 3rd party service that highlights “cloud-agnostic development”. Therefore, learning Terraform can land you a job in companies using any cloud platform and not only AWS. Next up is my favorite service of all, the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Development Kit, Cloud Development Kit. As a passionate developer, I was swinging my legs back and forth when i",

As a passionate developer, I was swinging my legs back and forth when i discovered CDK. All the possibilities of leveraging this tool swirled through my mind. AWS created CDK, that uses CloudFormation in its backend, and gave developers every reason to be comfortable with IaC. Are you uncomfortable with JSON or YAML or declarative code in general? Go ahead, write IaC in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, . Net, and Go. Finding it hard to start learning? Here you go, take this cornucopia of documentation, CDK Documentation . Do you fear that your application might fall behind because of changes to AWS services? AWS CDK is regularly updated by AWS to reflect new services and features. Now to delve into the details of some fascinating CDK commands and features: CDK synth: Use this command to change your code from whatever language you’re using to YAML so it can be deployed on CloudFormation. CDK deploy: Warning! Use this command in a development environment only! The following code, if applicable to your templates, deliberately introduces drift into your CloudFormation stacks in order to speed up deployments: The CDK CLI: It will use AWS service APIs to directly make the changes if possible; otherwise, it will fall back to performing a full CloudFormation deployment. CDK watch: This command brings a similar concept to the table. With this, each save to your code, your stack is deployed. In the case where auto-save is on, your infrastructure is up-to-date almost all the time as CDK is ‘always watching’. Wrapping up. In conclusion, cloud infrastructure deployment offers a spectrum of methods catering to various levels of expertise and convenience. Whether navigating the AWS console, mastering the CLI, or leveraging the power of Infrastructure as Code, each approach presents its unique set of advantages and challenges. Prominent IaC tools and services such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) each bring distinct benefits to the table. CloudFormation offers robust features that facilitate infrastructure management across multiple AWS accounts and regions. Terraform’s cloud-agnostic nature and powerful HCL language make it an invaluable tool for multi-cloud environments.

The Components of AWS Bedrock Agents The Bedrock Agent development platform is made of 5 main components. We’ll go over each component below. Agent details Agent Details is the principal component to configure when building a Bedrock Agent. It’s the only required component. In Agent Details, you specify instructions to your agent, detailing everything from its purpose to its tone, behavior, the rules it has to follow, as well as information about the tools and knowledge it has access to. You also specify the agent’s AI model, its name, as well as a few extra additional features. Pro-Tip: The clearer and more detailed your instructions, the better your agent behaves. Follow the prompt guides of the provider whose model you choose for your agent. Here are links for some: Action groups Action Groups allow you to add functionalities to your agents which go beyond just responding to queries. They allow your agent to call lambda functions and other APIs via API Gateway when it see fit. You can define action groups with: Lambda function details, in which you create a lambda function containing the function tools the agent will call. OpenAPI schemas, which allow you to define APIs your agent can call via lambda or an API Gateway. Pro-Tip: Even though they’re optional, it’s important to give detailed descriptions to your action group functions and their parameters. This will help your agent call the right function at the right time . The more function tools you want to give your agent, the more it becomes important to describe in detail what every function and parameter does. Knowledge bases Knowledge bases allow you to equip your agent with extra domain-specific information which you want your agent to be able to access. Your agent will query the knowledge base you equip it with in order to enhance its responses and improve its ability in invoking groups. Knowledges bases take S3 as their data source, and you can attach up to 5 data sources to a single Knowledge Base. Pro-Tip: Attach metadata files to your data source S3 files. Metadata files could greatly enhance search accuracy and open up new search techniques and possibilities for your agent. Refer to AWS’s guide on Metadata Files: Set up a data source for your knowledge base – Amazon Bedrock Guardrail Details Guardrails allow you to have finer control over the content you want your agent to engage with.

You can create guardrails to configure content filters, define blocked messages, as well as add denied topics, word filters, and sensitive information filters. Guardrails ensure your agent’s remains well behaved and focused on the scope of which it was created to fulfill. Pro-Tip: Although a powerful tool to keep your agent in-check, too many guardrails can severely limit the functionality of your agent, as well as lead to potential false positives – situations where the system incorrectly identifies a risk or violation that isn’t actually present. Advanced Prompts Under the hood, AWS Bedrock Agents go through a 4-step prompting process before returning answers to the users. These steps are: Pre-processing Orchestration Knowledge base response generation Post-processing (disabled by default) Advanced Prompts allow you to take a look at the prompt given to the system at each step and customize it to your will. You can also enable and disable any of those steps (except for the orchestration step if your agent has action groups and/or knowledge bases). You can also define a Lambda function to parse the raw LLM output and derive key information from it to be used in the runtime flow. This can be done for every prompt component mentioned above. Pro-Tip: Advanced Prompts is a very powerful feature, allowing you fine control over every component of your agent system. Although might be intimidating at first, taking the time to learn and experiment with prompts at every step of the prompting process may prove very beneficial in taking your agent’s performance to the next level. One Final Component: You Bedrock Agents are built up from multiple components which can work together to create truly marvelous autonomous systems. Optimizing each of these components and linking them together efficiently is like assembling together a piece of art. Yet behind every great work of art, there’s a great artist, and behind every great AI system, there’s a greater engineer. These autonomous systems don’t shine on their own, but shine by the great minds which engineer them. Thus, behind all of these components which make up an AI agent, let’s not forget the most important one, you .

For the full step by step documentation please review my blog post on dev.to at: Creating Interactive Globe Visualizations with Globe.gl: A Step-by-Step Guide using Amazon S3 and CloudFront Note: this is a community based project and we would be more than thrilled to have your contribution or feedback at community@digico.me to help in shaping it for the AWS community. 1. Building the Visualization with Globe.gl and Three.js: Globe Creation: We recommend using Globe.gl, a library built on top of Three.js, to simplify the process of creating 3D globe visualizations. Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating and animating 3D computer graphics. We will use JavaScript code to interact with Globe.gl and configure functionalities like globe appearance, lighting, and camera controls. The step-by-step guide mentions specifying images for the globe itself and potentially a background image to enhance the visualization. User Group Pins: We then transform the AWS user group data (available in the JSON format) into visual elements like pins displayed on the globe. The format is as such: [ { “ugName”: ” AWS User Group Timisoara”, “ugLocation”: “Timisoara, Romania”, “ugURL”: “https://www.meetup .com/aws-timisoara”, “ugCategory”: “General AWS User Groups” } ,{ “ugName”: “AWS Abidjan User Group”, “ugLocation”: “Abidjan, Ivory Coast”, “ugURL”: “https://www.meetup .com/groupe-meetup-abidjan-amazon-web-services/ “, “ugCategory”: “General AWS User Groups” }, The complete data extraction and processing detail is available in the step-by-step guideline. These pins can be customized with attributes like size, color, and information popups that appear when clicked by the user. This allows users to explore details about the AWS user groups at specific locations and to provide more detail for the user. Dynamic Arcs (Optional): We created dynamic arcs to visually connect different user groups on the globe whereas each arc start-point and end-point are representative of an AWS User Group. This can be achieved using JavaScript code to calculate and render these arcs based on user group locations. 2.

      "original_text": " group locations. 2. Deployment on AWS S3 for Global Accessibility: Setting Up an S3 Bucket: We used Amazon S3, a scalable and cost-effective storage service offered by AWS (Amazon Web Services), to host the visualization files. You’ll need to create a bucket within your S3 account and give it a unique name that follows AWS naming conventions. In the example, the bucket is named “usergroups.digico.solutions,” which aligns with the intended subdomain for the website. This is essential if you would like to only host through S3 Static Hosting. If coupled with CloudFront, different set up could be implemented. An important step is to untick the “Block all public access” option to allow public access to your website files, ensuring anyone can view your visualization. Configuring Static Website Hosting: After uploading your visualization files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) to the S3 bucket, you need to enable static website hosting. This tells S3 to serve your website files when someone tries to access the website through a web browser. This can be done by navigating to the bucket’s “Properties” section and enabling static website hosting. You’ll also need to specify the name of your index document (usually “index.html”) which acts as the entry point for your website. Enabling Public Access with Bucket Policy: By default, S3 buckets might not allow public access. To ensure your website is accessible globally, you’ll need to create a bucket policy that grants public read access to your objects. The guide walks you through the steps of creating a policy using the AWS Policy Generator. This involves specifying that the policy allows the “GetObject” action for the principal “” (everyone). Note: this policy is very permissive and usually only specified Principals are allowed. For example, the CloudFront distribution on top of the S3. You’ll also need to include the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of your S3 bucket in the policy document. 3. Securing and Serving with CloudFront for Enhanced Performance: Obtaining an SSL Certificate: To secure your website and encrypt data in transit, we obtain an SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). This ensures user privacy and builds trust with your visitors. Note that the certificate must be requested in the ‘N. Virginia” region. Select the “Request a public certificate” option and specifying the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or subdomain you plan to use for your website (e.g., “usergroups.d",

Select the “Request a public certificate” option and specifying the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or subdomain you plan to use for your website (e.g., “usergroups.digico .solutions”). Then, choose DNS validation and select “RSA 2048” as a common and secure key algorithm. Managing DNS Records: To use your SSL certificate, you’ll need to make changes to your domain’s DNS records. These records point your domain name to the S3 bucket where your website files reside. For our setup, we are using Lightsail’s DNS management for demonstration purposes, but the process can be similar with other domain registrars or DNS hosting providers. You’ll need to create a CNAME record that maps your desired subdomain to the CloudFront distribution domain name we’ll configure in the next step. Configuring CloudFront: To improve website performance and user experience globally, we suggest using Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service offered by AWS which has 310+ Points of Presence (300+ Edge locations and 13 regional mid-tier caches) in 90+ cities across 47 countries. CloudFront caches your website content across the multiple edge locations around the world, delivering it to users First off, create a CF distribution and set your S3 bucket as the origin. Configure the regions and add the certificate that was requested. Create a CNAME record in Lightsail to point your domain to your Cloudfront distribution. Finally, you will have the domain ready to display your AWS user group globe! Final Thoughts & Contribution Thank you for following along the journey of creating an exciting yet beneficial and well-rounded AWS project. This project has demonstrated the power of leveraging AWS services to build a comprehensive solution. We successfully integrated backend development with a user-friendly frontend and design, culminating in a rapid deployment on AWS.

To retrieve your form’s corresponding code onto your local machine, use the command as shown below: For a web application, choose JavaScript: Depending on the front-end framework that you prefer, you have the option to automatically create your project in any of the following. This tutorial will use React. An example of using the Amplify-generated React component as instructed in the App.js file with the imports in the file as instructed in Amplify Studio highlighted below: To be able to make a request as specified in your API (to be seen later), use the fetch method in React to send the user input to the back-end. Most notably, specify the api invoke url with the resource path appended at the end (you will get these from API Gateway in following steps) , method , the headers and which will respectively allow for Authentication and CORS verification, and the body containing the user’s message to be processed by the SageMaker endpoint in the backend. For security purposes it is better to save your API Key as an environment variable before you use it. To call this function, retrieving the generated text from SageMaker, pass your user’s message as follows, and use the data returned in your webpage by converting the response to JSON format and accessing the property’s value within the JSON object.

First, you must ensure that the status of the endpoint is InService . To do this, search for the SageMaker service in the AWS Management Console, and navigate in the sidebar to Inference > Endpoints. To create a Lambda function, search for the Lambda service in your AWS Management Console and click ‘Create Function’: In the next step, choose the option to ‘Author from scratch’, name your function, and choose the programming language. This tutorial uses the latest version of Python for the function code. For the execution role, select a new role with basic Lambda permissions as shown below. This is crucial to provide the function with the necessary permissions to function as planned and access other AWS services and resources. After creating the function, the execution role should show up in the Configuration tab of the function as shown below: Click the execution role to be redirected to the specific permission policies included in your function’s role, and select ‘Add permissions’: You will need to add permissions to the Role by clicking ‘Create inline policy’: This action redirects you to the page for policy creation where you will click ‘JSON’ to be able to write a JSON description of the required permission in the editor. The following is the JSON form of the required permission which enables the Lambda function to invoke any SageMaker Endpoint. Then you will name your policy, and, as you can see, the associated permission added allows reading from SageMaker. To confirm that the permission has been successfully added to your Lambda function’s role, check the Permissions tab of the role, and you should see a new permissions policy in the list, similar to what has been shown below: Now that the permissions have been set up, back to the Lambda function. The Lambda function’s task is to interact with the SageMaker endpoint when requested.

It has significant applications in the fields of language comprehension and text/ response generation. This model is offered in two sizes: Falcon-7B, which typically requires only a single GPU, and Falcon-40B, which requires multiple GPUs and will be used in this article. In this tutorial, we will be diving into harnessing the power Falcon-40B using Amazon SageMaker to optimize the hosting, deployment, and use of such models. SageMaker features large model inference deep learning containers (LMI DLCs) which are optimized to handle such models that require high memory and complex computations. On the backend, these containers can distribute model parameters and computations between several GPUs. What is SageMaker? Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service by AWS for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and capabilities, including data preparation, model training, and deployment. With SageMaker, users can create and manage training environments, choose from built-in algorithms or bring their own models, and benefit from automated model tuning and distributed training. It simplifies deployment with managed hosting and scalability for real-time inference, while offering built-in monitoring and logging features. In short, SageMaker accelerates the development and deployment of intelligent applications with its ease of use and scalability. How about Hugging Face? Hugging Face is a company responsible for the development of the open-source library “Transformers”, which provides a wide range of pre-trained models which includes various NLP tasks, like large language models with impressive performance. Hugging Face also offers the Hugging Face Model Hub, a platform to find, share, download, and edit pre-trained models. This tutorial will assume your model is on Hugging Face to benefit from Amazon SageMaker’s new integration with this platform. Overview The main steps to take your model from trained and stored to deployed and usable in Amazon SageMaker are: Reference the model: Define your model in Amazon SageMaker, specifying the necessary information such as the container image, model artifacts, and any configuration specifications. Create an endpoint configuration: Configure the endpoint settings, including the instance type, instance count, etc. and be sure to specify the LMI DLC as the container image for the endpoint.

Deploy the endpoint: Start the deployment of your model by creating an Amazon SageMaker endpoint using the previously defined endpoint configuration. Cleanup: Remove resources you no longer need Before starting Using SageMaker offers plenty of options to fine-tune your model deployment, which you can use to maximize the throughput and inference power of your model. First and foremost, choose your instance size and type based on your model’s size, parameters and memory requirements. For example, most models require GPU acceleration for enhanced performance and inference speed and SageMaker recommends ml.g4 or ml.p3, which are GPU-backed instances. To increase throughput, SageMaker features a batch transform functionality, which allows you to perform inference on your model’s input data offline and process the data in parallel. Moreover, to further reduce your model’s inference latency, you can leverage the Result Caching feature to store frequently accessed results and Result Aggregation to collect multiple requests into a batch. After deploying your endpoint to use your model, it is best to configure automatic scaling provided by SageMaker to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on the inference traffic. Walkthrough Note: To write and run commands and code, you can use SageMaker notebook instances or SageMaker Studio notebooks.

In this blog, we’ll go on board a journey through the concepts of backup and recovery, discussing the intricate dance of data protection, and exploring the importance of having a robust backup strategy. How It Works In backup and recovery processes, incremental backups represent small saved segments of your data. A full system restore, on the other hand, is a rebuild of all your system from the available saved backups you have performed. Having your digital empire on the cloud is the safest option for your data’s availability, but no where is completely safe, your infrastructure is in one availability zone per-se, but what if a natural disaster hits that precise zone? Thats why you make a copy of your data to a place elsewhere, far from your original zone, and there you can choose how to store that copy. Your servers, your strategy. Strategies are divided into four kinds: Backup & Restore: Ideal for users prioritizing availability and cost optimization, even at the expense of longer recovery times in terms of RPO and RTO. Pilot light: Tailored for users seeking a balance between readiness and cost-effectiveness, the Pilot Light strategy is optimal. This approach maintains a minimal operational core, similar to a pilot light, allowing for rapid scale-up during recovery while minimizing costs associated with regular operations Warm standby: This strategy keeps a partially active system ready. This approach strikes a balance, offering faster recovery times than a Pilot Light while maintaining cost efficiency compared to a fully operational system. Multisite or Active/Active: This option utilizes a fully operational copy of your active system, all configurations replicated, with zero downtime and near zero data loss, and made for mission critical services, aka, not for the faint of heart, as it is the most expensive of all options. Backups are often categorized into three parts: Full backups : During this procedure, all information housed on a production server is moved to a backup server for safekeeping. The time needed for full backups is flexible, spanning from several hours to potentially days, contingent on the amount of data being conserved. These backups protect every bit of data originating from a single server, database, or virtual machine (VM). The",

      "original_text": ". The time needed for full backups is flexible, spanning from several hours to potentially days, contingent on the amount of data being conserved. These backups protect every bit of data originating from a single server, database, or virtual machine (VM). The efficiency of a data management solution can influence how often and how quickly full backups occur – contemporary solutions often demand fewer full backups, and when performed, they are completed efficiently. Incremental backups : This type of backup captures only the new data introduced since the last full incremental backup. However, it is important to note that an initial full backup must be completed before performing the first incremental backup. Differential backups function similarly to incremental backups in that they add more data since the last full backup. However, the key difference lies in the reference point, which is the last full backup, not the last incremental one. Organizations typically establish specific policies regarding the frequency and timing of incremental or differential backups based on their data management needs. In the next section, we’ll delve into the significance of backup and recovery, exploring why these practices are not just a safety net but a beacon guiding your digital ship through the stormy seas of potential data loss. Importance It’s not merely about avoiding the rain; it’s about dancing through the digital storm confidently, armed with an umbrella of comprehensive data protection. Explore with us why backup is more than just a routine; it’s a fundamental practice ensuring that even if the ship encounters turbulent waves, your data sails through unharmed. Bad things can always happen, whether it’s a sandstorm, flood, hurricane, cyberattack etc.. no system is built with 100% availability, thats why backup is that important. Equivalent to taking an umbrella with you everywhere in Europe, it might be summer and sunny, but you never know what happens next. Some of the important benefits that come with backup and recovery are: Data protection: Pretty self explanatory. Business continuity: Since backups get you back in no time, you’ll be minimizing downtime, minimizing costs with it. Regulatory compliance: Many industries and businesses are subject to regulations that mandate data protection and retention, which can be satisfied by taking regular backups. Data evolution: With the help of versioning, you can go visit the ghosts of the past, your old data, and see how far you’ve gone, and how that data has been updated. Safe data, happy life: Peace of mind is priceless, why live a business life with one extra concern. Services and Solutions You might be wondering, what can someone use to achieve a fully backed",

Let’s start with a little history lesson. Back in the day before cloud architecture and virtualization were the talk of the town, engineers and developers used to build applications and IT-focused businesses at a much slower pace and with excruciating limitations. This was mainly due to having to take into account the availability, maintainability, and cost of managing hardware and the overhead that would have to host and maintain the underlying hardware. From there a few problems came to light: There was no one-size-fits-all solution available that could cover all the intended use cases for dev teams and organizations which limited what was possible with available hardware. Traditionally, the requirement to run any sort of IT operation required physical hardware which proved costly and limiting in terms of maintainability and scalability. Data analysis and the attainability of actionable insights was a far-fetched dream. Innovation was extremely bottlenecked by the availability of funds and manpower. And so on. With cloud adoption, Sky’s the limit Enter the era of the cloud, where data is at the fingertips of any business, scalability is automated by gigantic providers with unlimited resources, physical hardware is no longer tangible, and virtual hardware is readily available from anywhere on the globe. Cloud adoption allows businesses of all sizes to leverage limitless resources in a cost-efficient manner. The only possible limitations are the ambition of the group and the skillset of its individual counterparts. By employing strategic digitization, migration, and optimization strategies, almost anyone can take advantage of the sheer power of cloud computing to build upon or develop any technology they aspire to have.

Its applications span numerous domains, including customer operations, marketing, sales, software engineering, research, and development. It even extends its transformative reach within your organization, enhancing productivity and accelerating processes. On the creative front, generative AI can weave together a diverse array of media content, from generating images to crafting blog posts and personalized email communications to your customers. On the technical side, you’ve likely witnessed impressive integrations such as GitHub Copilot, which assists developers in generating code suggestions based on their code and comments. But before we dive in, let’s set up the stage into how we have generative AI. Evolution to Generative AI In the intricacies of generative AI, it’s essential to establish a solid foundation by examining the broader landscape of AI. The term “AI” often seems enigmatic, and to comprehend it better, we’ll start with a fundamental question: What is AI, exactly? AI serves as an encompassing term for a diverse array of advanced computer systems. However, for a more precise perspective, let’s narrow our focus to “machine learning.” Much of what we encounter in today’s AI landscape can be categorized as machine learning—imparting computer systems with the ability to learn from examples. When we speak of machines learning from examples, we often refer to them as “neural networks.” These neural networks acquire knowledge through exposure to numerous examples. For instance, teaching a neural network to recognize the Eiffel Tower entails feeding it a vast and varied collection of images capturing the landmark from various angles and perspectives. Through this extensive training and appropriate labeling, the model gains the ability to distinguish the Eiffel Tower in a photograph from other elements, enabling swift and accurate recognition. Language Models In the context of Generative AI, the process shares some similarities, primarily revolving around language models, a unique category of neural networks. Language models excel in anticipating the next word within a sequence of text. To enhance their predictive capabilities, these models undergo extensive training with substantial volumes of textual data as well. One method for refining a language model involves exposing it to a more extensive corpus of text, mirroring how humans expand their knowledge through study. Consider, for example, the phrase “I am flying on an…”; a well-trained language model can accurately predict “I am flying on an airplane.” As training deepens, the model’s proficiency grows, enabling it to generate nuanced responses",

Consider, for example, the phrase “I am flying on an…”; a well-trained language model can accurately predict “I am flying on an airplane.” As training deepens, the model’s proficiency grows, enabling it to generate nuanced responses and offer valuable insights into the probable continuation of the sentence. Evidently, this forms the revolutionary foundation for what we now refer to as “Generative AI.” Building upon the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can have up to hundreds of billions of parameters, Generative AI excels at creating entirely new content based on the knowledge it has accumulated. Currently, Generative AI extends its reach beyond text, delving into various media formats, including images, audio, and even video.

This system empowers you to exert control over the data accessible to the LLM during response generation, ultimately improving the quality of generative AI. In essence, RAG enables LLMs to tap into additional data resources without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. Creating your own LLM can incur expenses ranging from $450,000 to millions of dollars, with a training duration that could extend to months 2 . Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot with Amazon Titan models The first step of this process to generate text based on specific relevant data is to generate embeddings. These are numeric vectors that represent the textual data. Amazon’s Titan Embeddings model is specialized for this purpose and can generate the embeddings corresponding to your data. Once, the embeddings have been saved in a storage service such as S3, a lambda function can perform a similarity search using this vector database to retrieve only the data relevant to the user’s query. Next, this relevant data, also known as the context, is sent along with the user’s query to an LLM which will generate the appropriate response within the right context. Amazon’s Titan Text Express model is a suitable LLM for the job. Using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge bases , you can provide your model with context without having to add the extra step of performing the similarity search. Once your data is added as is as a Knowledge base to the model of your choice with the choice of a model to handle embeddings, the vector database is created on your behalf, and relevant information is automatically found based on the user query and combined with the query to generate an accurate response from the LLM basaed on the relevant context. Adding Speech to Text Layer To go the extra mile, you can use Amazon Transcribe to accept the user’s query in audio format and Amazon Polly to return the response to the user in audio Format. The architecture diagram below shows a high-level overview of the AWS services needed to create the well-rounded generative AI service to be integrated into existing business applications. Setting Up the Source S3 bucket The first step is uploading the user’s queries in a consistent audio format to an S3 bucket from the user’s device/application. For this S3 bucket, event notifications are needed to automatically trigger the audio transformation. For this, we can choose the option to create Event Notifications in the Properties section of a designated S3 bucket.

We specify a suffix to match objects of a specific format to prevent mismatched formats during processing since we will need to declare this format later in the triggered transcription lambda function. For Event Types, we specify to match Put events according to the method used from the application to upload the audio file to the S3 bucket. As a destination of the event notification, we select the Lambda function and choose the created trigger Transcription function. This way, every time a new audio file is uploaded, it will be transcribed and sent to the LLM for a corresponding response. Trigger Transcription Lambda function Before diving into this function’s code, we need to enure that it has the appropriate permissions to function correctly. It will need a role assigned to it that contains the following permissions to programmatically start a transcription job using Amazon Transcribe and to delete the job once done to clean up resources. It should also have permissions to read S3 objects and to write to the output bucket specified in the transcription job ( and permissions respectively). The function’s code can be found below. It first retrieves the Amazon S3 bucket name and object key from the Amazon S3 event notification that triggered its execution. Then, it creates and starts a transcription job that converts the audio from the Amazon S3 bucket into text saved in a json file along with metadata and confidence measures in the output bucket. When the transcription is over, the lambda function cleans up resources by deleting the transcription job based on its name and status of execution. Copy Generate Text Lambda function The next step is to set up Event notifications on the textQueriesBucket to trigger the generateText Lambda function as done previously but without the suffix. This Lambda function has to be assigned a role that contains the permission policies to read data from the textQueriesBucket S3 bucket and put objects to the audioResponsesBucket S3 bucket ( and permissions). The function needs permission to call the Bedrock service as well. Finally, the function needs the permission to access and use Amazon Polly service. As for the function’s code: Copy This function retrieves the S3 object details (bucket and key) from the Lambda event object. Then, it reads the object and parses the transcription text from the object. The function then invokes the model available in Amazon Bedrock, passing it the user’s query transcribed.

Think of a world where your data escapes physical boundaries, overcomes hardware limitations, and resides in an imaginary repository accessible from anywhere, at any time, with unequaled ease and security. This is the realm of Cloud Storage, the technological genie that liberates your data from the shackles of physical solutions and offers a new era of limitless possibilities. In this blog, we will delve into the reasons why cloud storage is considered the clear winner, paving the way for both businesses and individuals. Performance, longevity, price, and interfaces of traditional storage alternatives vary. All these factors are taken into consideration by architects when selecting a storage option for a particular project. It’s important to note that numerous IT configurations and application designs combine various storage systems. Each of these technologies has been chosen to satisfy the needs of a certain form of data storage or for the storage of data at a particular point in its life. A hierarchical system of data storage tiers is created by these combinations. Some of these technologies are: Memory: In-memory storage solutions, including file and object caches, in-memory databases, and RAM disks, enable swift access to data. Databases: Structured data is typically housed in various types of databases, including traditional SQL relational databases, NoSQL non-relational databases, or data warehouses. These databases are usually stored on SAN or DAS devices, and in some cases, in-memory storage. Storage area network (SAN): Dedicated SANs with block devices like virtual disk LUNs often offer the highest level of disk performance and durability for storing critical business data and database information. Backup and Archive: Data retained for backup and archival purposes is generally stored on non-disk media like tapes or optical media. These are typically kept in remote, secure locations off-site to ensure disaster recovery. Message Queues: Temporary data storage facilitates the transfer of information between different application components or computer systems. Network-attached storage (NAS): NAS storage offers a file-level interface that can be shared across multiple systems but tends to be slower compared to SAN or DAS solutions. Direct-attached storage (DAS): Local hard disk drives or arrays within individual servers deliver superior performance compared to SANs but offer less durability for both temporary and persistent files, database storage, and operating system (OS) boot storage. As for AWS, you can find plenty of offerings for cloud-based storage options. Each has a special blend of features like scalability, elasticity, performance, durability, availability, cost, and interface. For web-scale",

Startups and developers should embrace continuous experimentation and adaption right from the start. So thinking and researching MVPs and writing this down as the closest I could get to define an MVP process or startup process. So you got a hypothesis, if you don’t have a hypothesis you really should have a hypothesis, you don’t really build something because you can but you want to know what is the right thing to build, what do my customers care about? Additionally, aim to have a tight and measurable hypothesis that’s clear and defined. Then you want to build this, and ideally, you want to build the minimum possible to disprove that hypothesis, if you can’t then you keep going, then you’re going to need to measure it, because you can’t disprove or prove something if you don’t measure. Once you measure you can start to learn and iterate, and as you iterate onwards, you will then start building or altering on that first phase. You can see that build, measure, iterate phase it continuous you keep going round and round and round. Although we have a scale at the end of the diagram above, it’s better to think of that as a build measure iterate phase as well there no real distinction between them.

Think about the clarity of what you are trying to achieve, because when you want to measure something you want something that’s singular and within your aim. I speak to a lot of startups but when I ask them what their benefit is, I get a list. Its really always good to start with a really clear and singular mission, something that you can deliver that’s really crisp to your customers.\n\nYou want to make sure it’s measurable. If you can’t measure it, you can’t know if you succeed against your metric, you might not know what’s the right value to get to is but you need at least to have a measure to know where you are in relative terms. MVP MVP stands for a minimum viable product, its the first product that you build and is the product that gets your startup through the product-market fit phase. It’s not a prototype so it’s not to be confused with a prototype. A prototype is something you create to see if your idea is feasible if it’s like a hardware idea or helps you find a happy path for UX for your users to know how they experience your web app or mobile app. Or just to get a visual so that people can see what are you trying to build. So an MVP is not a prototype, and there are certain situations where you build a prototype before you build an MVP or you might have both an MVP and a prototype to be testing things on the side. This is the minimum number of features to test your hypothesis, and it is very important because a lot of people overbuild their MVP. It’s very common, and you especially see a lot of overbuilding when you have people who never been around software development teams before or worked in a software development team. And overbuilding happens when you build features beyond what is needed to test your hypothesis. Lets take Lyft as a good example of an MVP. What is Lyft trying to solve originally when they first released their product? They are trying to see if peer-to-peer transportation could work. So the minimum number of features they need to test their hypothesis is: Driver to be able to sign up and log-in. Rider to be able to log-in and signup. The rider is able to request a driver and driver to be able to find that rider. A form of payment to be exchanged between the two parties which they can take their cut off. That’s all the basic features needed without all the features you see now on Lyft like share your ride",

That’s all the basic features needed without all the features you see now on Lyft like share your ride on social media or add a stop or hundreds of other features you see now which if they had on their MVP it would have been overbuilding. There are other kinds or other terms referring for the minimum viable product: Viable: It’s the referred to most commonly and it’s a completely new product to test new dimensions of the product. Usable: Minimum Usable Product its to get your product in the hands of customers and make sure it’s usable and get early feedback. Lovable: If you release a minimum lovable product, you are assuming the product existing in the market is disliked by the customers. And you are releasing a minimum lovable product saying that like I think I can do better than x competitor and here’s why. Testable: Minimum Testable Product is good for risky business assumptions for example Airbnb or Lyft. “If you aren’t embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late.” Reid Hoffman LinkedIn CoFounder Remember it should be very minimal and it doesn’t matter how great the UI or UX looks. It just needs to be functional because you are trying to prove a single hypothesis with the minimum number of features. I’ve met a lot of startup founders who are perfectionists (I’m a perfectionist too) but you shouldn’t wait until you product is perfect but until it’s functional and useful at least at a basic minimal state and ship it out and get people using it and see if they actually like it. Because if they need it and want it they will not really care how it looks like or how beautiful it is. They’re going to just start using it immediately. How many people actually care what Lyft looks like. Few people only care because when you need a ride you need a ride. Why do you care if there’s a button for me to request a ride? A way to pay the driver. Great, I’m all set. So it’s good if you are a perfectionist that there is someone on the team to push you to ship before you are ready.

Let’s take a look at the approach of how you think about your hypothesis or MVP. So if you can imagine this pyramid or stack of what a product is, so this is what you want at the end. You want everything colored in, everything completed, usable, valuable, reliable of course, to scale, and to be a great experience that’s beautiful for your users. I spend a lot of time with people trying to build MVPs and we all try to take a slice of them and build them out. If your a designer there’s a very good chance you’ll start from the top and you’ll have an incredibly beautiful MVP or if your an engineer with an infrastructure background, you’d have an incredibly scalable product or if your a site reliability engineer, its gonna be reliable, if you’re on the business side and get that proposition right, it would be really valuable, or if your an application engineer you’d make a really usable product. But the question is which one of these do I do? But the simplest way to describe it is if you focus on one of them you don’t want to go super wide. You want to actually touch on all of them. So imagine this as an approach, your MVP needs to address a certain slice of everything, that’s why its really important to think whats the minimum feature that will allow you to build that exact thing. Product Evolution MVP is obviously not a customer-facing term, while your first customers are gonna be your early adopt",

Product Evolution MVP is obviously not a customer-facing term, while your first customers are gonna be your early adopters and your product will still need work. If we are trying to solve the hypothesis of transportation for people we might start with a skateboard then move to a scooter then get more complicated from there. That’s why an MVP should be the really bare-bones, it shouldn’t be the wheel or tire and you don’t release it until you have a car. That’s an overbuild. Don’t get distracted with features outside your scope and don’t get distracted by things that don’t prove your hypothesis at its basic core level. It’s better to have something that flows and can be progressively useful as you go on. Each one of these phases could be considered a product. If you were to build the wheels in the first phase and the engine in the second, you wouldn’t have something useful whereas here I can get A to B in the first phase “skateboard to bike to car, I can still achieve the same goal you are trying to do, your vision from one place to another but better and better over time and it’s still a minimum viable product at each stage.

These leaders set the bar high, then they constantly raise it. 14 leadership principles Amazon Workers Refer to on a Daily Basis: Whether you’re interviewing for a job at Amazon–or crafting a list of values for your own business. Customer Obsession Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. Ownership Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.” Invent and Simplify Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. Are Right, A Lot Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs. Learn and Be Curious Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them. Hire and Develop the Best Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice. Insist on the Highest Standards Leaders have relentlessly high standards and many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. Think Big Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. Bias for Action Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. Frugality Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. Earn Trust Leaders listen",

Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. Earn Trust Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best. Dive Deep Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly. Deliver Results Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle. Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness.
